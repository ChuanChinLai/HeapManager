# HeapManager

This HeapManager can be used in C++ memory management.

1. Designed and implemented regular memory allocator for memory pool management. 
2. Supported Fixed-Size Allocator, which is faster than regular allocator. 
3. Overloaded operator New and Delete. 


Please see my example in main.cpp and Unit_Test.cpp. 
Any suggestions and comments are welcome.
